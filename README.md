Hearing Aid Using Digital Signal Processing
Abstract
This project presents a software-based digital hearing aid built using Altair Compose and Altair Embed. It simulates and processes audio signals using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques such as filtering, gain control, and Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis. The system targets the enhancement of speech clarity for hearing-impaired individuals, addressing common hearing aid limitations like poor noise reduction and delayed audio response. The processed audio is exported as `.wav` files and analyzed in real-time using spectrum plots.
1. Problem Statement
Despite advancements in hearing aids, several critical shortcomings still exist:
- High latency in sound processing.
- Poor noise reduction in dynamic environments.
- Lack of personalization.
- Feedback (whistling) due to poor suppression.
- No 3D sound experience.
- Manual tuning not user-friendly for elderly users.
This project aims to overcome these limitations using DSP techniques via software.

2. Objectives
- Simulate a digital hearing aid entirely in software.
- Apply DSP filters (low-pass, high-pass, bandpass) to improve clarity.
- Implement adaptive gain to enhance speech-specific frequencies.
- Analyze output using Power Spectral Density.
- Visualize signal flow and processing via Altair Embed.

3. Tools and Technologies Used
Altair Compose: Signal processing (audio read/write, filtering, PSD)
Altair Embed: Real-time block diagram simulation and visualization
.WAV Format: Used for both input and output audio signals

5. Methodology
In Altair Compose:
- Import raw `.wav` voice signals.
- Normalize audio and apply bandpass filters and adaptive gain.
- Generate processed `.wav` files.
- Run PSD analysis to visualize clarity and noise levels.

In Altair Embed:
- Load the processed `.wav` output.
- Apply additional 100 Hz High-Pass Butterworth Filter.
